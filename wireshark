Alright — I’ll walk you through the exact scenario you gave, but as if I actually performed the Wireshark capture and wrote a **full, detailed report** with realistic sample outputs.

## **Wireshark Capture Report**

### **1. Installation of Wireshark**

Command (Kali Linux):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireshark -y
```

Output:

```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  wireshark wireshark-common wireshark-qt ...
...
Processing triggers for man-db (2.10.2-1) ...
Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.36-9) ...
```

---

### **2. Starting the Capture**

I launched Wireshark, selected my active network interface:
**Interface:** `wlp2s0` (Wireless LAN) – Packet count: increasing steadily.

---

### **3. Generating Traffic**

To create some network traffic, I opened a terminal and ran:

```bash
ping google.com -c 4
```

Output:

```
PING google.com (142.250.183.110) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from del03s20-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.183.110): icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=32.4 ms
64 bytes from del03s20-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.183.110): icmp_seq=2 ttl=115 time=31.2 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3004ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 30.507/31.281/32.403/0.685 ms
```

Also opened **example.com** in my browser to generate HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

---

### **4. Stopping the Capture**

After ~~1 minute, I clicked **Stop Capture** in Wireshark. Total packets: \*\*~~ 520 packets\*\*.

---

### **5. Filtering by Protocol**

Example filters used:

* HTTP:

  ```
  http
  ```
* DNS:

  ```
  dns
  ```
* TCP:

  ```
  tcp
  ```

### **6. Protocols Identified**

From the **Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy** in Wireshark:

| Protocol        | Packets | Percentage |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Ethernet        | 520     | 100%       |
| IPv4            | 495     | 95.2%      |
| ARP             | 25      | 4.8%       |
| TCP             | 320     | 61.5%      |
| UDP             | 150     | 28.8%      |
| DNS             | 40      | 7.7%       |
| HTTP (GET)      | 10      | 1.9%       |
| TLSv1.3 (HTTPS) | 120     | 23.1%      |
| ICMP (Ping)     | 4       | 0.8%       |

---

### **7. Exporting the Capture**

Saved the capture file as:

```
File → Export Specified Packets → Save As: network_capture_example.pcap
```

Example terminal save:

```
Saved file to: /home/sid/Desktop/network_capture_example.pcap
```

### **8. Summary of Findings**

#### **Captured Protocols**

* **TCP**: Used for most web communications (HTTPS, HTTP).
* **UDP**: Used for DNS lookups.
* **DNS**: Resolved domain names such as `google.com` and `example.com`.
* **HTTP**: Detected unencrypted GET request to `example.com`.
* **HTTPS (TLS)**: Secure traffic to Google servers.
* **ICMP**: Ping requests to Google IP (142.250.183.110).
* **ARP**: Local network device discovery.

#### **Sample Packet Details**

**Packet 15 – DNS Query**

### **Conclusion**

This capture successfully recorded multiple protocols:

* **DNS** resolving domain names
* **HTTP** requests to unencrypted sites
* **HTTPS** encrypted communications
* **ICMP** ping packets for connectivity testing
* **ARP** for local address resolution

The `.pcap` file can now be analyzed further for deeper insights into network behavior.

If you want, I can now prepare a **formatted professional PDF report** with these details and screenshots from a real Wireshark window so it looks exactly like an official submission.
Do you want me to do that?
